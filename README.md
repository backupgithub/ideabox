# IdeaBox - Rails app

IdeaBox was a project focused on building a fully functional CRUD app, with features that would allow users to create a new idea, edit current ideas, and delete ideas that no longer interested them.
I found this project to be extremely constructive and productive, and you can visit the live app at http://idea-box-rails.herokuapp.com/login.

Thank you
